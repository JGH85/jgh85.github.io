                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p> The look of the Eternal City as we know it today
                        was changed forever by the artistic genius of
                        Gianlorenzo Bernini. Below we will explore some
                        of his greatest works in Rome.</p>

                <h2>St. Peter's</h2>
                    <p> Bernini was also influential in shaping the final look
                        the greatest basilica in the world. From the forest of
                        columns in his colonnade, to his "mixed media" celebration
                        of the authority of the Popes in the Cathedra, his
                        ambitious projects are at the center of every pilgrim's
                        experience of the tomb of the greatest of the Apostles.</p>
